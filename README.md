# System.Data.SQLite
An SQLite library for nanoframework

This is work in progress, and is subject to change!

Although Microsoft.Data.Sqlite was an option https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/standard/data/sqlite/compare

In an embedded environment, this is not practicable. Instead, the implementation was based upon GHI TinyCLR (to get working) but (due to licence uncertainty) implements major moves to using https://github.com/Faithlife/System.Data.SQLite as its primary source.
